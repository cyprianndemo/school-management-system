# School Communication Portal

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a School Communication Portal, a web-based application designed to facilitate communication between teachers and parents. The portal is developed using a combination of SQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS.

The primary objective of the School Communication Portal is to create a platform where parents can stay updated about their children's academic progress and school activities. It allows parents to:

- View a list of all teachers
- Search for specific teachers
- Send messages to teachers

Teachers, on the other hand, can:

- Receive and respond to messages from parents

The portal also includes a secure login system, where users can log in as an admin, teacher, or parent. Each user type has access to different modules, providing a personalized user experience. The login system is designed to be secure, with measures in place to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Functionality

- **Parent Features**:
  - View list of teachers
  - Search for teachers
  - Send messages to teachers

- **Teacher Features**:
  - Receive and respond to messages from parents

## Database Design

The database for the portal is designed with various tables to store information about admins, teachers, parents, students, and messages. The relationships between these tables are carefully structured to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

## Technologies Used

The School Communication Portal project utilizes a variety of technologies for its development:

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language is used for managing and manipulating the database. It's used to create tables, insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.
- **PHP**: PHP is a server-side scripting language used for developing web-based applications. In this project, PHP is used to handle the server-side logic, including the login process, data validation, and interaction with the database.
- **HTML/CSS**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content on the web page, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation aspect of the site. The login form and other elements on the page are structured using HTML.
